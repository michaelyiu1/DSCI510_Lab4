    "## Phone Number Extractor\n",
    "\n",
    "In this question, you are tasked with implementing a function that extracts phone numbers from a given string using regular expressions. The phone numbers may appear in various formats, and you need to standardize and filter them according to specific rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The phone numbers in the text can appear in the following formats:\n",
    "- (XXX) XXX-XXXX (e.g., (123) 456-7890)\n",
    "- XXX-XXX-XXXX (e.g., 123-456-7890)\n",
    "- XXX.XXX.XXXX (e.g., 123.456.7890)\n",
    "- +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX (e.g., +1-123-456-7890)\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of how the phone numbers are presented in the text, all extracted phone numbers should be returned in the format +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX. For example:\n",
    "- Input format (123) 456-7890 should be returned as +1-123-456-7890\n",
    "- Input format 123-456-7890 should be returned as +1-123-456-7890\n",
    "- Input format 123.456.7890 should be returned as +1-123-456-7890\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Phone numbers in the format (XXX) XXX-XXXX usually include a space after the closing parenthesis, such as (123) 456-7890.\n",
    "However, phone numbers without the space, like (123)456-7890, are also allowed and should be treated as valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "- If a phone number appears more than once in the text (the same phone number in different formats should be deduplicated), it should only be included once in the final list.\n",
    "- The phone numbers should be in sorted order\n",
    "- When parsing phone numbers from a string, it's important to account for punctuation marks, particularly the dot (.) that may appear at the end of a sentence or after the phone number. A text like *123-456-7890.* (with a dot at the end) should still be recognized as containing a valid phone number, but the dot should not be included as part of the phone number.\n",
